    <li class="fragment">Bake in <strong>ambiguity</strong> and <strong>interdependence</strong> across milestones.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Use <strong>visual specs</strong> and <strong>non-canonical formats</strong> to resist trivial generation.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Integrate <strong>cultural/ethical context</strong> to deepen engagement and relevance.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Provide <strong>in-class practice</strong> with similar patterns (prep for finals).</li>

    Future work: deploy similar midterms/in-class exercises so the final’s demands aren’t a first exposure; continue measuring validity beyond correlation (e.g., qualitative interviews).

    Design for interpretation, not recall. If the problem can be solved by pattern matching, AI will solve it.

Embrace ambiguity and interdependence. These force students to connect concepts and reason deeply.

Integrate culture and ethics. Context makes computing more meaningful and reveals its societal impact.

Practice these skills early. Students need exposure to this kind of reasoning before the final exam.
