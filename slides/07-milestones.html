    The second milestone required students to generate the Wiphala programmatically

. At its core, this is a problem of multidimensional indexing: repeating a sequence of colors across rows, but offsetting the sequence each time.

We deliberately avoided naming the Wiphala in the instructions. When we tested AI tools with that keyword, they generated nearly correct code. Without it, most produced incorrect diagonals or failed to reproduce the pattern entirely.

Students had to experiment with loops, slicing, and modular arithmetic to solve this — precisely the kind of deep reasoning we want them to develop. And because this step depends on the data structure they designed in Milestone 1, superficial or AI-generated solutions often collapsed here.”
