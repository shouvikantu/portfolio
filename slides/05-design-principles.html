    Ambiguity is pivotal: AI solves well-specified, templated tasks; ambiguity foregrounds modeling, interpretation, and judgment.

    Alignment with ACM CS1 outcomes – We retained all five canonical learning goals: fundamental Python, reading Python, strings and files, interactive graphics, and defining classes.

Intentional ambiguity – We deliberately left room for interpretation in prompts. Rather than telling students what data structure to use or how to solve a problem, we described the problem in general terms and left the design decisions to them.

Visual and image-based specifications – Code generators excel at solving text-described tasks, but they struggle with purely visual inputs. So we used images and pixel layouts as problem statements.

Interdependent milestones – Each part of the project built on the previous one. Students couldn’t solve a later step without understanding the earlier ones.

Cultural and ethical context – By centering the Wiphala, we embedded questions of cultural meaning, environmental impact, and ethical computing into a technical assignment. This helped students connect computation to broader social realities.”
