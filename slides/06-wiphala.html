    Also a frame for social/ethical reflection: link between AI data center demand and Andean mineral extraction and labor rights. The symbol’s meaning matters; students connect code to culture.

    “The Wiphala is a square, multicolored checkerboard flag used to represent Indigenous peoples of the Andes

. It symbolizes unity, diversity, and self-determination — and in our context, it also represents an opportunity to engage with computation in a culturally grounded way.

It also provided a chance to talk about the real-world consequences of computing. The demand for data centers — which power AI tools like the ones students use — is deeply linked to mineral extraction and labor exploitation in Andean regions
