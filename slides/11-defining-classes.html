    “The fourth milestone focused on abstraction and composition

. Students read filenames from a CSV, opened those files as images, cropped and scaled them, and then assembled them into a Wiphala-style collage.

Each image corresponded to a color’s cultural meaning — for example, a photo of a Bolivian lithium mine representing ‘verde’ as a symbol of natural resources. Students weren’t just coding; they were connecting computation to cultural narratives.

The ambiguity here was deliberate. Instead of giving precise pseudocode, we provided example output and told students to ‘visually inspect the diagonal.’ Students had to reason about how pixel data mapped to collage placement.

This step completely confounded most AI tools. Gemini misinterpreted the task as a 5×10 grid of unrelated images, while ChatGPT tried to generate a single concatenated image. Students, meanwhile, built pipelines that reflected real programming practice: integrating I/O, data manipulation, and logic into a cohesive whole.”
